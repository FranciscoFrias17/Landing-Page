## Project Description

Added dynamic functionality to the site through javascript functions. Created a navigation bar that sticks to the top of the viewport.

## Usage

Clicking a section scrolls down to that section and activates the background in the viewport. Navigation also sticks to the top of the viewfinder. 

The javascript functionality creates a nav bar that adds sections depending on the number of sections in the array.
